# Triage.AI

Our emergency response systems is broken. 
Call center employees are being overworked, under-equipped, prone to pranks and this is all coming from the Toronto emergency dispatch audit themselves. 
Emergency calls are being left on hold for up to 10 minutes on end and the Toronto dispatch center has actually failed to meet its minimum standard for answering calls almost every day last year.

This is our lives on the line… there needs to be a better system. 

With this Triage.AI was born, an AI-based chatbot prototype and robust management system to answer, assist, triage and streamline call center processes until a real dispatcher becomes available. With an AI bot handling calls right away until a real dispatcher is available, a new approach of this callibre has the potential to save so many lives, by freeing up dispatcher so that they can handle more emergencies faster and focus on coordinating dispatch processes.
